Usage is extremely simple.

new SOSTrace();

Optionally, it takes a host and port number for remote connections.

new SOSTrace("192.168.2.12", 8989);

Subsequent calls to trace() will be forwarded to SOSmax, defaulting to the debug log level. An optional second parameter is the log level:

trace("There's been a fatal error!", SOSTrace.FATAL);

Additionally, string replacement is also optional using AS3 style tokens:

trace("Object at point : ({0}, {1}).", SOSTrace.DEBUG, point.x, point.y);
